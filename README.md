Each makefile provides a `make help` command that describes the
available commands.

## Programming The Icebreaker Board
To be able to program the icebreaker board to display a sobel image, you must be in the sobel_core folder and run the command `make prog`.  This will also create a .nplog file that will show you how many LUTs your board uses, your max clk frequency, and other info.

## Changing Image To Apply Sobel Filter
To change the image you want to apply the sobel filter to, you must insert the .jpeg image into the Matlab_image_to_hex, rename it to color_image.jpeg, and run the Matlab_image_to_hex/image_to_hex.m file on matlab.  Doing this will create a file named gray_image.txt in the sobel_core/input_image.  NOTE: inorder for the image to properly display on the Icebreaker board, the image must be rescaled to have a width: 160 and height: 120: this is the default. Then you can do the steps in the Programming The Icebreaker Board section.

## Displaying The Converted Image On Matlab
After converting an image to it's hex values in Matlab, you can generated a file named image_out.txt, which is the hex values of the image with the sobel filter applied, in sobel_core/image_out.  To do this you must be in the sobel_core folder and run the command 'make test_verilator' which will run testbench.sv. In the testbench, there are image height and image width parameters that must match the height and width used in Matlab_image_to_hex/image_to_hex.m. After the simulation is done, you must open Matlab and run Matlab_image_to_hex/hex_to_image.m.  This will display a visual representation of the image_out.txt file.  NOTE: You must use the same width and height as the original image.

PMOD Digital Video Interface: [link to buy](https://1bitsquared.com/products/pmod-digital-video-interface?variant=11770730020911&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjw_MqgBhAGEiwAnYOAehxQyjnhFbSThXkY0NzWJkbUuMskxvQQC1vccm7IIo_w61NTHTmSuhoCrkUQAvD_BwE)

## Hardware Setup
The PMOD DVI must be connected to PMOD ports 1A and 1B.  An example can be seen [here](https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-graphics/).

## Tools
To be able to run this project you will need the following tools:

- *Icarus Verilog*: https://bleyer.org/icarus/ (v10.0)
- *Verilator*: https://verilator.org/guide/latest/index.html (v5.0)
- *GTKWave*: https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/ (v3.0)
- *Yosys*: https://yosyshq.net/yosys/ (v0.23)
- *nextpnr-ice40*: https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr (v0.4)
- *project-icestorm*: https://clifford.at/icestorm (No Version)

### Typical Installation - All Operating Systems
If you are running on Ubuntu, create `/etc/udev/rules.d/50-lattice-ftdi.rules` (you will need to use sudo), and paste the contents: 

    `ACTION=="add", ATTR{idVendor}=="0403", ATTR{idProduct}=="6010", MODE:="666"`
    
Otherwise you will get the eqivalent of a 'device not found' error when running `iceprog`.


### Advanced Installation - Linux	
If you like doing things the hard way, you can use these
instructions. Please ensure that you have the correct versions (listed
above).

- On Ubuntu/Debian-like distributions, run: `sudo apt install iverilog verilator gtkwave yosys nextpnr-ice40 fpga-icestorm`

- Then, create `/etc/udev/rules.d/50-lattice-ftdi.rules` (you will need to use sudo), and paste the contents: 

    `ACTION=="add", ATTR{idVendor}=="0403", ATTR{idProduct}=="6010", MODE:="666"`
    
- Double check your installed tool versions against the ones above.


### Advanced Installation - MacOS
- Install Homebrew: https://brew.sh/
- Run: `brew install icarus-verilog verilator gtkwave`
- Run: `brew tap ktemkin/oss-fpga`
- Run: `brew install --HEAD icestorm yosys nextpnr-ice40`

### Advanced Installation - Windows
